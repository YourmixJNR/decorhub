# Decorhub - Tailwind CSS Learning Project

This repository contains my implementation of the Decorhub eCommerce store design, which I used to learn and practice Tailwind CSS. A responsive web application featuring a wide range of interior decoration products.

The original Figma design can be found at [Figma Design Link](https://www.figma.com/file/vfrCfggtIx3PFnae1I8mxX/3legant-E-Commerce-UI-Design-Template-(Community)?type=design&t=zYVOnCKmgPRHvF2F-6).
